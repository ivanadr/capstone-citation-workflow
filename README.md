# Suggested Capstone Workflow for References

## Zotero

- The main advantage is that it creates a references with one click and even saves a pdf

- Zotero takes 30 minutes to learn, ideally before having more than 15 references
- download pdf of each paper into Zotero
- annotate in the Zotero ipad app or the desktop app (or both) (I think this is better than saving it into Goodnotes)
- when writing, either insert reference manually or from Zotero, or just keep track of things that you have read
- For Notion users: there seems to be a plugin called Notero (Notion + Zotero)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IC8-mPbjCo&t=374s&ab_channel=HollyJane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IC8-mPbjCo&t=374s&ab_channel=HollyJane)

## Citation style

- any citation format is fine for Econ MLA, APA, Chicago. I used APA.

## Quick Alternatives to Zotero

- to keep track of references when writing drafts
1. text + link
    - e.g. The food system is responsible for about 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions [(Crippa et al., 2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00225-9)
2. google docs
    - Google Docs Citation manager (upside: easy to use, downside: manual entry most of the time)
3. word 
    - Word Citations Manager
